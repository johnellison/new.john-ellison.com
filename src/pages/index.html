        <h3>Startup Redesign & Product Launch</h3>
        <p>
          I was fortunate to work as project lead for a Norwich startup called <a href="https://www.pikl.com">Pikl</a> for their biggest initiative to date. We rebranded, redesigned their website and launched a whole host of new products. Working directly under Pikl CEO Louise Birriterri, I ran a series of back-to-back sprints to test key assumptions about how to meet her customer's needs.
        <p>
          The new launch helped position Pikl as the leading insurance provider for the sharing economy in the UK and helped secure over a two million pounds of investment for Louise and her team to scale.

        <h3>Lean Startup Validation</h3>
        <p>
          I worked with visionary vicar and entrepreneur David Lloyd at <a href="#">STN</a> in Norwich to define and validate a startup concept that emerged out of five years of rapid growth.</p>
        <p>
          We ran four back-to-back design sprints where we tested four prototypes with 24 users, validated problem-solution fit and identified the target market.

        <p class="lead">It has been a privilege collaborating with John. Â John is someone who can take a vision and is hungry to understand it, distill it, communicate it, critique it and break it down into raw commercially viable components so that the dream can start to become a reality.
        <p class="lead"> Rarely do you find such a mix of skills in one person. Â Through the intensive Design Sprint process Cultivate was able to turn into reality in a matter of weeks. Â John is a â€˜must haveâ€™ for your team.</p>
