        <h3>Lean Startup Validation</h3>
        <p>
          I worked with visionary vicar and entrepreneur David Lloyd at <a href="#">STN</a> in Norwich to define and validate a startup concept that emerged out of five years of rapid growth.</p>
        <p>
          We ran four back-to-back design sprints where we tested four prototypes with 24 users, validated problem-solution fit and identified the target market.

        <h3>Product Strategy & Roadmap</h3>
        <p>
          As product manager of Open Town Hall, I worked with an incredible team at <a href="https://opengov.com">OpenGov</a> to create a unified product roadmap for Citizen Engagement that brought together multiple products with input from: marketing, sales, customer success, design and engineering.
        <p>
          We used customer interviews and competitive analysis to derive strategic priorities for a unified product suite.

        <h3>Product Redesign & Acquisition </h3>
        <p>
          I led a remote product team at Peak Democracy through a major redesign and startup acquisition. We identified core usability problems, iterated solutions with customers and continually released improvements into production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I worked with the executive team to fulfill a multi-million dollar merger and acquisition with a venture-backed startup in Silicon Valley.
