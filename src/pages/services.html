        <h3>Do you have a brilliant idea for a new product?</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          I use <a href="#">Design Sprints</a> to take months of product work into just four days. This method that emerged out of Google Ventures and has helped companies from Slack to Lego scale successful products. I learned how to run sprints directly from <a href="https://www.jakeknapp.com">Jake Knapp</a>, the creator of the design.

        <p class="lead">
          I use <a href="#">Behavior Design</a>, a research-backed system out of Stanford University, to create lasting behavior change through digital products and services. I was fortunate to train directly with <a href="http://www.bjfogg.com">Dr. BJ Fogg</a> and am now the only certified Behavior Design teacher in Europe. If you're a company on a mission, we should talk.

        <h3>Do you have an existing product with complex challenges?</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          I use product design and management methods to understand problems, develop empathy and test solutions with real users. My approach is highly collaborative and multi-disciplinary. You and your stakeholders can rest assured that your product and its users are in experienced hands.
